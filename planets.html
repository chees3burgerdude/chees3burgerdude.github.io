    <p class="space">The planets we know and love most are probably the planets in the <i>Solar System</i>. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
    <p class="space">Since we all are quite familiar with these planets in our <i>Solar System</i>, there will be some <mark>fun facts</mark> about all these planets.</p> 
    <p class="space"><mark>Mercury</mark> is the <i>closest</i> planet to the sun and is also the <mark>smallest planet</mark> in the Solar System, it is about the size of the <i>moon</i>! It only takes <mark>88 days</mark> for mercury to orbit the sun which means <i>1 year</i> on mercury is only <i>88 days</i>!</p>
    <p class="space">Venus is the second closest planet to the sun and is the <i>hottest planet</i> in the Solar System although it is further away from the sun than mercury. Venus is almost the <mark>exact same size</mark> as earth but rotates in a different direction. Seen from earth, Venus is the <mark>second brightest</mark> natural object in the night sky after the Moon.</p>
    <p class="space"> Earth is most obviously our <mark>mothering planet</mark>. It is the <mark>third closest</mark> planet from the sun and unlike mercury or venus, earth has <i>one moon</i> while mercury and venus do not have any moons. <mark>70%</mark> of the earth is covered in water, but only <mark>3%</mark> of the water is freshwater, and only <mark>1.2%</mark>  of the water is <i>drinkable</i>. The <i>Earth's Atmosphere</i> Extends to a Distance of <mark>10,000 km</mark>. The Earth's Molten Iron Core Creates a <mark>Magnetic Field</mark></p>
    <p class="space"> Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is also known as the <mark>Red Planet</mark> There is a <mark>mountain</mark> on mars that is <i>3 times</i> the size of Mount Everest. Mars has <mark>2 moons</mark> called <i>Deimos</i> and <i>Phobos</i> which are both quite small compared to the Earth's moon. Mars is also <i>smaller</i> than Earth with a diameter of <mark>4217 miles</mark>. In the middle of Mars and Jupiter, lies the Asteroid Belt which is full of asteroids of different shapes and sizes.</p>
    <p class="space">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and is also the biggest planet in the Solar System. Jupiter has a <mark>"Big Red Spot"</mark> The Great Red Spot is a <i>storm</i> in Jupiter's southern hemisphere with crimson-colored clouds that spin <mark>counterclockwise</mark> at <i>wind speeds</i> that <i>exceed</i> those in any storm on Earth. The Great Red Spot has slowly changed over the years, and is currently about <mark>1.3 times</mark> as wide as our planet. Jupiter is a gas giant, which means that Jupiter is <mark>mostly made out of gases</mark>, more specificly, <mark>Hydrogen and Helium</mark>. Deep in the atmosphere, <i>pressure</i> and <i>temperature</i> increase, <i>compressing</i> the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of <mark>hydrogen instead of water</mark>. Jupiter is actually a <mark><i>failed star</i></mark>, as Jupiter has same elements (Hydrogen and Helium) as the sun, but it is <mark>not massive enough</mark> to have the <mark><i>internal pressure</i></mark> and <mark><i>temperature</i></mark> necessary to cause <mark>hydrogen to fuse to helium</mark>, the energy source that <mark><i>powers</i> the sun and most other stars.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is actually a <i>gas giant</i> as well. Saturn is the most <mark>distant planet</mark> that can be seen with the naked eye, and was known to the ancients, including the <i>Babylonians</i> and <i>Far Eastern observers</i>. Saturn orbits the Sun once every <mark>29.4 Earth years</mark>, and Saturn's <i>upper atmosphere</i> is actually divided into <mark>bands of clouds</mark>. The rings on saturn are mostly made of <mark>ice and rock</mark> of different sizes.</p>
    <p class="space">Althoug Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun, it is still the <mark>coldest</mark> planet in the Solar System. Uranus orbits the Sun <i>on its side</i> and believe it or not, Uranus actually has <mark>rings</mark>. Uranus has <mark>27 moons</mark> and a <mark>Season</mark> on Uranus lasts one long day – <mark>42 years</mark>. The <i>atmosphere</i> of Uranus contains <mark>“ices”</mark> and is the <i>second-least dense</i> planet.</p>
    <p class="space">Neptune is the furthest planet from the sun and is the <mark>smallest gas giant</mark>. A year on Neptune actually lasts <mark>165 Earth years</mark> and Neptune is named after the <i>Roman god of the sea</i>. Believe it or not, Neptune actually has <mark>6 faint rings</mark>. (Yes a lot of planets have rings XD)</p>
    <p class="space">There are actually planets other than earth that are <mark>habitable.</mark> Planets like <mark><i>Kepler-186f, Gliese 581c, Kepler-452b, Gliese 667 Cc etc.</i</mark> can all be habitable with good technology. These planets can all be habitable as the <mark>condition on these planets resemble a lot of the conditions on earth.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">And that will conclude this page on info about planets! Enjoy reading the other pages!</p>

    <p class="space">At first, there was nothing in the universe. Well, nothing except <i>dark matter</i>. But suddenly, every speck of the <mark>universe's energy</mark> jammed into a <mark>very tiny point</mark>. This extremely <mark>dense</mark> point exploded with <i>unimaginable force</i>, creating <mark>matter</mark> and propelling it outward at the <i>speed of light</i>. Astrophysicists dubbed this titanic explosion the <i>Big Bang</i>.</p>
    <p class="space"><mark>1 minute</mark> after the big bang, the base of everything in the universe today also known as <i>quarks</i>, was almost finished. The temperature of the universe was around <mark>10^32 Kelvin</mark>, which is an <i>incredible</i> amount of heat.   Around <mark>3 minutes</mark> after the big bang, the temperature of the universe was still incredibly high at about <mark>10^9 Kelvin</mark>.</p>
    <p class="space">At this point, everything in the universe was "cooling down". And the base of all the stars, planets etc. we know today were <mark>being formed</mark>. The universe was <i>expanding</i> to create and contain all of these matter. All the small particles known as quarks that was formed at the start of the big bang started grouping together due to <i>gravity</i>, which formed <mark>protons and neutrons</mark>. But other than protons and neutrons, there were <i>electrons</i>, flying around in space all alone but could not group with the quarks as the universe was <mark>too hot</mark>.</p>

    <p class="space">Around <mark>10 minutes</mark> after the big bang, the protons and neutrons also grouped together to form <i>hydrogen</i>, which is a group of <mark>one proton and one neuntron</mark>. And there was also <i>helium</i>, which is a group of <mark>two protons and two neutrons</mark></p>
    <p class="space">About <mark>380,000 years later</mark>, the universe was <i>cool enough</i> for the <i>elctrons</i> to finally join in with the protons and neutrons to form more <mark>helium and nitrogen</mark>, and the universe is basically a <mark>bunch of gas</mark>.</p>
    <p class="space">Over the span of <mark>600 million years</mark>, all that happened in the universe was the <i>gases</i> <mark>compressing</mark> due to <i>gravity</i>. Until another <i>explosion</i> happened due to how <mark>dense</mark> the gases were and *drum roll* a star was made! Besides a star being made, a lot of <mark>new elements</mark> like oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, nitrogen etc. This process was then repeated a lot of times, and <mark>all sizes</mark> of stars were made. Of course, the stars <i>die out</i> too, but when <i>bigger stars</i> die out, they create <mark>supernovas</mark>, that create even <mark>more elements</mark>. </p>
    <p class="space">Those elements that were made turned into even more <i>interesting stars</i> which also died out and created <i>more supernovas</i>, and formed <mark>ice, rock, and some other things</mark>. But those rocks are also known as our <mark>planets, asteroids, dwarf planets, moons etc.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">And all that basically concludes the origin of the things in our univers!</p>

    <p class="space">There are many galaxies in the universe, and the one we our Solar System is in is called the <mark><i>Milky Way Galaxy</i></mark>.</p>
    <p class="space">Almost every large galaxy has a <mark>supermassive black hole </mark> in the middle of it. The only galaxy discovered that does not have a black hole is the galaxy <mark><i>M33</i></mark>. Although, there is another galaxy that has somewhat <mark>"lost"</mark> its black hole. The bright cluster galaxy <mark><i>A2261-BCG</i></mark> has been observed with a <i>supermassive black hole</i> in the middle of the galaxy before, but when astronomers observed it once again, its black hole <mark>could not be located</mark>.</p>
    <p class="space"><i>Galaxies</i> contain all kinds of things. Like stars, <mark>nebula clouds (more info on the nebula clouds page)</mark>, dust, gases, ice etc. Galaxies are <mark>incredibly large</mark>, and usually <i>supermassive black holes</i> would be found in large galaxies. But, there are also <mark><i>dwarf</i></mark> galaxies that have been observed with supermassive blackholes in the middle of the galaxy too! <mark>13 dwarf galaxies</mark>, to be exact.</p>
    <p class="space">Supermassive black holes has a diameter of about <mark>78 billion miles</mark>. For perspective, that's about <mark><i>40%</i> the size of our solar system</mark>, according to some estimates. And it's estimated to be about <mark>21 billion times</mark> the mass of our sun.</p>
    <p class="space">The nearest black hole to earth is known as <mark>"The Unicorn"</mark>. The galaxy is just 1,500 light years away from earth, and is roughly <mark>three times the mass</mark> of our sun. Its <mark>strong gravity</mark> alters the shape of its companion star in a phenomenon known as <mark><i>tidal distortion</i></mark>, making it <i>elongated</i> rather than <i>spherical</i> and causing its light to change as it moves along its <mark>orbital path</mark>.</p>
    <p class="space">There is a dwarf galaxy near us called the <mark><i>Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy</i></mark>. The galaxy sits <mark>236,000,000,000,000,000 km (25,000 light years)</mark> away from the Sun. The second closest dwarf galaxy to us is called the <mark><i>Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy </i></mark>, sitting at <mark>662,000,000,000,000,000 km (70,000 light years)</mark> away from the sun.</p>
    <p class="space">The closest galaxy to the Milky Way is <mark><i>Andromeda</i></mark>, which is around <mark>2.6 million light years</mark> away from us. Many galaxies are more than <mark>100,000 light years</mark> across in distance. It takes over <mark>two hundred million years</mark> for the sun to orbit the center of the galaxy. This is called a <mark><i>galactic year</i></mark>.</p>

    <p class="space">A <mark><i>nebula</i></mark> is an enormous <mark>cloud of dust and gas</mark> occupying the space between stars and acting as a nursery for new stars. The roots of the word come from <mark>Latin nebula</mark>, which means a “mist, vapor, fog, smoke, exhalation.” Nebulae are made up of <mark>dust, basic elements such as hydrogen and other ionized gases</mark>.</p>
    <p class="space">
    A nebula (gas cloud) <i>slowly contracts</i> under the <mark>mutual gravity of all of the atoms</mark> in the cloud. The nebula flattens into a <mark>disk.</mark> <mark><i>Gravitational</i></mark> contraction also causes the <mark>pressure to increase</mark> which causes the cloud to <mark><i>heat up</i></mark>. Mass concentrates into the center and pressures and temperatures here become the <mark>greatest.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">The clouds <mark>mix and churn</mark>, which creates magnetic fields. There are <mark>several types of molecular clouds</mark>: dark globules, emission nebulae, and reflection nebulae. <mark>Emission nebulae glow</mark> as their gases are <mark>heated</mark>. Reflection nebulae are <mark>mostly dust</mark> which reflects the light from nearby stars.</p>
    <p class="space">
      Nebulae are <i><mark>huge interstellar clouds of gas and dust</mark></i> that range in size from 1 AU to 10 AU, and which are <mark>less dense</mark> than the deepest vacuum in Earth's laboratories. Just one portion of of a nebula the size of Earth would weigh only <mark>a few kilograms!</mark>The closest nebula is the <mark><i>Orion Nebula</i></mark> at more than <mark>1300 light years</mark> from Earth.</p>
  </body>
  <p class="space">
  The temperature of the gas in the nebula is about <mark>10,000 degrees Celsius</mark>, and the <i>central stars of planetary nebulae</i> are among the <mark>hottest stars in the Universe</mark>, with temperature in the range of <mark>25,000 to over 200,000 degrees Celsius.</mark></p>

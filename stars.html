    <p class="space">Stars, like our sun are mostly made of <mark>Helium and Hydrogen.</mark> Stars shine by <mark>turning hydrogen into helium in its core.</mark> This process is called <mark><i>nuclear fusion.</i></mark> Fusion happens when lighter elements are forced together to become heavier elements. When this happens, a <mark>tremendous amount of energy is created.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">The smallest stars in the universe are known as <mark><i>red dwarf stars.</i></mark> Red dwarf stars have masses from about <mark>0.08 to 0.6 times</mark> that of the Sun. Objects smaller than red dwarf stars are called <mark><i>brown dwarfs</i></mark> and do not shine through the <i>thermonuclear fusion</i> of hydrogen. Lighter stars are much more <mark>plentiful</mark> than heavier stars, and red dwarfs are thus the <mark>most numerous type of star.</mark> The biggest star in the unviverse is <mark><i>Stephenson 2-18</i></mark> The Stephenson 2-18 is <mark>2,150 times that of the Sun</mark>. Every star you see in the night sky is actually <mark>bigger and brighter</mark> than our sun. Stars don't twinkle, so... the lullaby "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" is false... yup. </p>
    <p class="space">The average star is between <mark>1 and 10 billion years old</mark>, although some stars are older than this. Large stars live <mark>shorter lives</mark> compared to smaller stars, because large stars <mark>burn through their fuel much faster</mark>. Giant stars explode into a <mark><i>bright supernova</i></mark> when they die which would cause and immense amount of energy to be released and <mark>failed supernovas</mark> would form a black hole.</p>
    <p class="space">Stars can sometimes produce solar flares, a solar flare is a sudden flash of <mark>increased brightness</mark> on the Sun, usually observed near its surface and in close proximity to a <mark>sunspot group.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">Normal stars and dwarf stars are not the only stars that exist, there are also neutron stars that are formed when a massive star <mark>runs out of fuel and collapses.</mark> The very central region of the star – the core – collapses, <mark>crushing together every proton and electron into a neutron.</mark></p>

    <p class="space">Neutron stars are typically about <mark>20 km (12 miles)</mark> in diameter. Their masses range between <mark>1.18 and 1.97 times</mark> that of the Sun, but most are <mark>1.35 times</mark> that of the Sun. Neutron stars have some of the <mark><i>strongest gravitational and magnetic fields</i></mark> in the universe. The gravity is strong enough to <mark>flatten almost anything</mark> on the surface. The magnetic fields of neutron stars can be <mark>a billion times to a million billion times</mark> the magnetic field on the surface of Earth.</p>
    <p class="space">Thought this star saga was over? Nope! There is another variation of neutron stars called <mark>Magnetars!</mark> Magnetars are formed just like a neutron star. Magnetars are around <mark>20 kilometres (12 miles)</mark> in diameter and have a mass about <mark>1.4 solar masses.</mark> They are formed by the <mark>collapse of a star with a mass 10–25 times</mark> that of the Sun, so in summary, Magnetars are even more dense than neutron stars and Magnetars have an <mark>insanely strong magnetic field</mark>. If you go within 1000km of a Magnetar, the magnetar's powerful magnetic field could <mark>instantly scramble and atoms and bioelectrical field of the human body</mark>. In other words, tear up the body's molecular structure, causing humans to <mark>disintegrate instantly.</mark></p>
    <p class="space">Magnetars unlike other stars, have crusts, just like earth. And because of this, Magnetars can get <mark><i>starquakes.</i></mark> When the crust of a Magnetar heats up and finally tears, a <mark>fireball of electrons, photons and plasma</mark> emerges as a bubble on the side of the star, researchers believe. A <mark>bright beam of <i>radiation</i></mark> attaches the fiery bubble to the magnetar, and emits <mark>a giant burst of energy.</mark> The closest magnetar from Earth lies about <mark>50,000 light-years</mark> away in the <mark>constellation Sagittarius.</mark> Magnetars are <mark><i>relatively harmless</i></mark>, but if one gets too close to Earth, it could <mark>destroy the entire planet and all life on it.</mark></p>
